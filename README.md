Final project: Stroke Prediction Analysis  
Path: Machine Learning and Explainable AI

Introduction:

The stroke Prediction dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. In this project, an explainable AI technique is used to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions and understand the factors influencing stroke prediction.
